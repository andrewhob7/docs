## TIA Minicut
This is special type of a minicut. Which is of itself special.<br/>
The main purpose of minicuts is to prepare you for another muscle gain coming after. You can achive it is by _low training volume_,_minimal-lower cardio_, _1-1.5% BW weekly loss deficit (which is around 500-1500kcal)_ and it is usually _2-6 weeks long_. <br/>

The difference between of normal minicut and TIA minicut `(Temporarly Improved Appearance)` is that TIA minicut prepares you to look amazing for a weekend. By that I mean that this type of minicut won't prepare you for muscle gain phase, but will make you look lean as possible in the shortest time possible. It is really tough and unsustainable for a long time. To be succesful in TIA minicut and what are we supposed to do:<br/>
- High training volume (we don't want to lose muscle mass)
- High cardio (as high as you can sustain in 3-6 weeks period - for most people _10-15k_ daily steps + other cardio)
- 1-1,5% BW weekly loss deficit (500-1500kcal)
- 3 to 6 weeks long, but if you want to get a visible result you want to go with longer path (around 5/6 weeks)
