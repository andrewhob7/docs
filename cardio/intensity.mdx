Ideally we want to minimize time involvement in cardio. So why don't we just do the harders cardio with highers intensity all the time?

## Intensity downsides
### Harder cardio
Harder cardio also means more fatigue, which we want to minimize. Here are some types of fatigue that can occur in at least 3 seperate ways: <br/>
- On rate of calories (systemic fatigue)
- On local muscle fatigue
- On impact (joint/connective tissue fatigue)

### Best forms of amelioration
- Cap most cardio at 140BPM
- Use whole-body or at least weight-bearing modatilies to reduce small muscle volume being acutely fatigued (elliptical and incline wald vs stationary bike)
- Low impact or limited impact (incline walking and elliptical vs jogging, sports, HIIT, etc.)

<Info>
    You can do those other things, but tabs on fatigue and intersperse lower-fatiguing modalities.
</Info>

## Best practices
- Stay under **150BPM** (if you go above, consider doing a few days hard, a few days easier and repeat)
- Watch out for your joints/conns (back it off if you have to, **BEFORE** it turns into something more serious)

## How to periodize cardio?
In general, as we know, you'll have to do the most amount of cardio during a weight loss phase, a bit less for maintenance and during muscle bulding phase you need to do enough cardio, that will keep you healthy and considerably lean, but also not too much, so it makes weight gain near impossible.<br/>
You want to push as much cardio as possible in the end of weight loss diet - approximately around week 11/12. So it's really at the end of the diet.<br/>

Let's have a closer look at it.

## Phases
### Fat-loss Phase
In fat-loss phase, you want to start with normal amount of cardio - around your baseline and add extra to account for half of deficit.
<Info>
    If your deficit is for example 500 calories, you want to burn extra 250 calories for weight loss. So you have to add an extra cardio to burn these calories.
</Info>
As you progress, you'll need to burn more calories, consider increasing cardio in conjuction with food decreases.

### Maintenance Phase
In your ** first week ** of maintenance phase decrease your cardio to maintenance levels.
<Warning>
    This does not mean ZERO cardio!
</Warning>
For most people its like `10k steps` or `6x per week of 120-140bpm dedicated cardio sessions` - 5x kg weight in calories
### Muscle-gain Phase
If you are starting muscle building phase, you don't want to exadurate it with cardio. Begin with maintenance leves and simply increase food intake to gain some weight (0.2-0.5kg/week = around 0.5-1lbs/week). In some cases consider dropping steps, for example to `8k steps/day` or `2.5x kg calorie per 6 day sessions`, but most likely you are able to just eat more.

### Active Rest Phase
Lastly active rest phase, in this phase you don't need plans, just stay active throughout day and have fun. Usually durition of this phase is 1-3 weeks.
