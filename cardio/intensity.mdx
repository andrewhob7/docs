Ideally we want to minimize time involvement in cardio. So why don't we just do the harders cardio with highers intensity all the time?

## Intensity downsides
### Harder cardio
Harder cardio also means more fatigue, which we want to minimize. Here are some types of fatigue that can occur in at least 3 seperate ways: <br/>
 - On rate of calories (systemic fatigue)
 - On local muscle fatigue
 - On impact (joint/connective tissue fatigue)

### Best forms of 
  - Cap most cardio at 140BPM
  - Use whole-body or at least weight-bearing modatilies to reduce small muscle volume being acutely fatigued (elliptical and incline wald vs stationary bike)
  - Low impact or limited impact (incline walking and elliptical vs jogging, sports, HIIT, etc.)

    <Info>
    You can do those other things, but tabs on fatigue and intersperse lower-fatiguing modalities.
  </Info>

## Best practices
- Stay under **150BPM** (if you go above, consider doing a few days hard, a few days easier and repeat)
- Watch out for your joints/conns (back it off if you have to, **BEFORE** it turns into something more serious)
