There are more myths and mistakes then we could possible go though, so here are the most popular and basic ones:

<Steps>
    <Step title="Trying to out-cardio a bad diet">
        If you have bad diet and eat junk food all the day or overeating, then you would have to spend rest of the day doing cardio. This isn't sustainable and usually most people doing it this way fails.
    </Step>
    <Step title="HIIT all the time">
        <sub>**HIIT = High Intensity Interval Training**<br/></sub>
        You can do it and you should do it, however don't do it all the time. It stretches your joint and if you do it too much, it can result into joint fatigue.
    </Step>
    <Step title="EPOC illusions">
        <sub>**EPOC = Execess Post-exercise Oxygen Consumption**<br/></sub> 
        What that means is that you burn majority of calories during cardio in short time. But you also burn a lot of calories for a really long time because your body is recovering from the cardio itself. <br/> This all is true but the recovery does not burn another 200kcal, most likely it is around extra 15-50 kcal and many people are relying on the recovery thinking that the recovery burns the majority of the calories. Which is wrong.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Not step tracking">
        If you are tracking steps, you are most certainly more motivated to move around, do challenges with other people about who has more steps or simply gives you some feedback on how active you are during your normal day. Overall if you are not tracking your daily steps, there is quite a big change that you'll do to many or fewer steps than intended. Plus some people will be more motivated to do the daily amount of steps they set.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Boring cardio">
        Some people do boring cardio and accepting it. Again, it is not really sustainable long-team and you aren't making this easy for yourself. Because if it bores you when you'll need to push yourself into it and after sometime you'll stop doing it anyway. There are plenty of cardio variations you can do and you'll enjoy!
    </Step>
    <Step title="Holding the handles on incline cardio">
        In case you are holding the handles, you're moving less mass around and also unloading work of your feet, you'll probably burn less calories and the calories on the machine aren't accurate anyway. Move your hands, burn more.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Counting durations indead of calories">
        "I do the threadmill for an hour". Also the effort matters. Setting up calorie number is better and help you stay on track, even though measuring burned calories is sometimes also hard.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Too low intensity">
        Under 120bpm on a machine is probably a waste of your time. If you just want to walk, you don't need machine for it, just walk in your local mall, park or house. Unless you love it in your gym, then sure, do what you like and enjoy.
