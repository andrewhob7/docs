First of all, we want to have varieties of cardio to choose from, so it won't become boring and we still burn required amount of calories, so?

## What form of cardio?
Primary metric we use is [SFTR](/cardio/basics), which stands for Stimuls to Fatigue/Time Ratio. <br/>
So how do we choose the right cardio for us? <br/>
We want cardio modalities that rank highly on at the same time:
1. How many calories they burn
2. How little fatigue they impose
3. How little time they take
These are three primary aspects on what we are going to pick our cardio modality.<br/>

Now let's look at it more precisely from SFTR standpoint: <br/>

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="How many calories they burn." icon="circle-1">
    What types of cardio burns the most calories. <br/>
    + • Higher intensities
    + • Whole-body 
    + • Body weight-bearing
    For examle: Boxing, bycicle also burns less calories than walking
  </Card>
  <Card title="How little fatigue they impose." icon="circle-2">
    + • Lower intensities
    + • Low impact
    + • Psychologically fun _(for example basketvall with friends)_
    + • Psychologically seamless to regular life _(for example step tracking)_
  </Card>
  <Card title="How little time they take" icon="circle-3">
    + • More whole body
    + • Higher intensities
    + • Small setup cost _(driving to gym)_
    + • Can be done with other useful activities _(step tracking while you are shopping)_
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Overall **higher intensities** are amazing for high calorie burning, on the other hand are bad for fatigue management and **lower intensities** are the other way around. So these aren't going to be the best choices. Having whole body cardio is benefitial, because it burns most calories in relatively short time and also it isn't focus only on one body part like running, cycling, basketball and the overall fatigue is more distributed. Also it is better for joints.

## Best SFTR Modalities
### List
- Whole body
- Low-Moderate Intensity
- Body-weight bearing
- Low impact
- Fun 
- Takes up very little time

### Common picks:
- Eliptical machine (120-140bpm)
<Info>BPM stands for beats per minute ⟶ heart rate</Info>
- Incline brisk walking (for more entertainment you can watch vids/podcasts)
- Step tracked life (best time-saver)
- Sports/hobbies you love to do and that burn lots of calories.<sub>But don't do high impact all the time, take some days for low impact.</sub>
