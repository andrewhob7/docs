First of all, we want to have varieties of cardio to choose from, so it won't become boring and we still burn required amount of calories, so?

## What form of cardio?
Primary metric we use is [SFTR](/cardio/basics), which stands for Stimuls to Fatigue/Time Ratio. <br/>
So how do we choose the right cardio for us? <br>
We want cardio modalities that rank highly on at the same time:
1. How many calories they burn
2. How little fatigue they impose
3. How little time they take
These are three primary aspects on what we are going to pick our cardio modality.<br/>

Now let's look at it more precisely from SFTR standpoint: <br/>
