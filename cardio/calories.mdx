## How much cardio should you do?
The most determining factor of cardio is the amount of calories burned.<br/>

There are 2 Basic Levels:

## Maintenence Level
To stay leaner and at any given weight you need to do a certain baseline of cardio.<br/>
If you are mostly  **inactive** **(above 5000 steps/day)** - you are sitting most of the day (getting things deliver to your door, taking lift instead of stairs, not walking around), an hour of cardio `that gets you sweating` is a good option.<br/>
For example: 5x calories per session per kg bodyweight, so if you weight 70kg, do cardio for certain duration that burns around **350** kcal.<br/>
If you are on the other side **very active (above 10000 steps)**, then you are getting enough cardio for general health and fat-abatement.

### Fat-loss Level
If fat loss is your priority, then you should take your planned deficit (proper _food diet is crutial_ for successful fat loss). Cover half of the deficit with extra cardio, the other half with food intake reduction.<br/>
Example: 0.45kg(1lb) per week = 500kcal deficit
<Warning>This calories are made up and are different for everybody. However on average 500kcal results in loss of 0.45kg(1lb)/per week for most people.</Warning>
So if we want `500kcal` deficit, we want to burn `250kcal` through cardio and `250kcal` with lower caloric intake (for Week 1).<br/>
Logically, the bigger the calorie deficit, the bigger the weight loss. However, **be carefull with lowering calorie intake too much! Most people should not go under their bare daily minimum so the metabolism and overall body are at optimal values. Also fast weight loss may result to bigger muscle loss, than fat loss.** <br/> 
After several weeks, you might want to make bigger deficit or add more cardio. <br/>
To make further adjustments, ask yourself:<br/>
 - Will adding more cardio make the fat loss harder?<br/>
 - Will taking away more food make it harder?<br/>
 Choose the option that is based on your answer.
 <Info> For example you're eating healthy food, you don't have food cravings, but you're doing  an amount of cardio that's realyl tiring you out and it's taking a long time. In this scenario, you'd probably take all or most of the new deficit that next 250 kcal you want to cut out and just cut out the food. On the other hand you're barely moving around, you're doing the bare minimum cardio and you have a lot of energy, but you're eating so little food that you're starving. Then increasing cardio is a better option.</Info><br/>

## Bulking
For bulking you can do the maintenence level. You don't want to overexadurate it with cardio.
