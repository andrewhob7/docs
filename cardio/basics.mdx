## How to use cardio
It should be used as secondary factor for both health or fat loss.
We should consider proper diet, sleep and lifestyle first. Resistance training outrank cardio and cardio itself should be made in moderation.<br/> **Doing cardio for long periods of time** - hours and hours of cardio - is a bad choise for health and fat loss and here is why:<br/>
**-** Doesn't burn as many calories as a nutritional deficit easily could<br/>
**-** You can always out-eat nearly any activity and prevent fat loss<br/>
**-** It is boring for most people and it takes up tons of time and sums tons of fatigue<br/>
**-** Is not physically or psychologically sustainable
<Tip>Focus on the fundamentals like good nutrition, sleep and resistance training first.</Tip>
